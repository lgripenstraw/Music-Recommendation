# Abstract
The purpose of this project is to create an entry to submit to a competition on
Kaggle involving music recommendations. The goal is to use machine learning to
generate predictions of whether a user will repeatedly listen to a song within
a month of first listening to it. The data provided by Kaggle for this
competition come from a music streaming service from Asia called KKBOX. To
increase the accuracy of our predictions, we also plan to pull in data from
other online streaming sources.
